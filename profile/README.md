Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the Euiseok Kim Neuroscience Laboratory at UC Santa Cruz. Our lab focuses on understanding the organizational logic of long-distance cortical circuits and the molecular mechanisms of their development, using mouse visual cortex as a model.

## Research Focus

The mammalian cortex is composed of numerous functionally specialized areas. Interactions between these areas, mediated by widespread yet precise cell type specific circuits, are central to the neural computations that generate perception, cognition, and behavior. Our research aims to develop a circuit-level understanding of this brain-wide neural network to elucidate fundamentals of the brain, mind, and behavior.
