## Areas 
We address these fundamental questions using novel neural circuit tracing systems with next-generation trans-synaptic viral tracers, mouse genetics, single-cell genome-wide sequencing, and in vivo imaging. My lab will address long-standing but previously unapproachable questions about how specific long-distance neural circuits are developed and organized at the single cell level, which will ultimately provide insights into neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.
